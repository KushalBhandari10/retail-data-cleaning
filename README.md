# 🛒 Retail Store Sales Analysis – Data Cleaning & Visualization

## 📌 Project Summary

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a messy retail store sales dataset with over **12,000+ transactions**. The data includes missing values, inconsistent entries, and formatting issues — perfect for showcasing real-world data cleaning and visualization skills using **Python**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – For data wrangling and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visual analytics  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For clean, readable code and explanation  
- **Google Colab** *(optional)* – For cloud-based sharing  
- **GitHub** – For version control and portfolio visibility

## 📊 What I Did

✅ Handled missing values (filled or imputed properly)  
✅ Converted data types and cleaned currency/number columns  
✅ Removed duplicates and standardized text  
✅ Analyzed and visualized trends in:
- Sales by category
- Top 10 products
- Monthly trends
- Payment method usage
- Discount impact on total sales
✅ Added markdown insights for each plot

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- 📦 **Total Sales by Category**
- 🏆 **Top 10 Best-Selling Items**
- 📅 **Monthly Sales Trend**
- 💳 **Sales by Payment Method**
- 🎯 **Discount vs Total Spent**
- 🔍 **Correlation Heatmap**
- 🔢 **Quantity Distribution Histogram**

## 🧠 Insights Discovered

- Certain product categories (like *Household Essentials*) generate most revenue.  
- Missing product entries can distort sales rankings.  
- Discounts don’t always lead to higher spending.  
- Most purchases are low-quantity but high-priced.
